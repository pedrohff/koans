# Koans

Programming exercises to keep my brain up to date with the languages I like to work with and mess with coding challenges, data structures, code complexity, performance, concurrency and such. The idea behind it is to build these scripts by using no IDE, just a simple Nvim linter, so I can keep fresh the basics of my preferred programming languages.

## Testing pattern

I built a tool to help me testing some given inputs in each exercises, so I'm slowly developing [Défi](https://github.com/pedrohff/defi), and that's why you may find some odd comments in the scripts.
